/**
 * Train, test, publish, and review the model
 * 
 * Creating a model is an iterative process with the following activities:
 * - Train the model: Train a model to learn intents and entities from sample utterances.
 * - Test the model: interactively or using a testing dataset with known labels
 * - Deploy:  a trained model to a public endpoint so client apps can use it
 * - Review: the model's performance and make improvements
