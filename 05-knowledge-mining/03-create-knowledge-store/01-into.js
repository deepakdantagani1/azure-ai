/**
 * Knowledge stores : save enriched data
 * 
 * While the index might be considered the primary output from an indexing process, the enriched data it contains might also be 
 * useful in other ways. For example:
 * 
 * 
 * ==> When an indexer runs the pipeline to create or update an index, the projections are generated and persisted in the knowledge store.
