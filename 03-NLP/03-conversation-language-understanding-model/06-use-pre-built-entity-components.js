/**
 * Use pre-built entity components
 * 
 * You can create your own language models by defining all the intents and utterances it requires, 
 * but often you can use prebuilt components to detect common entities such as numbers, emails, URLs, or choices.
 * 
 * 
 * You can have up to five prebuilt components per entity. Using prebuilt model elements can 
 * significantly reduce the time it takes to develop a conversational language understanding solution.
