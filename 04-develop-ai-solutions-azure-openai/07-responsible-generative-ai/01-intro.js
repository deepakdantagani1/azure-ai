/**
 * t defines a four stage process to develop and implement a plan for responsible AI when using generative models. 
 * The four stages in the process are:
 * 
 * ==> Identify potential harms that are relevant to your planned solution.
 * ==> Measure the presence of these harms in the outputs generated by your solution.
 * ==> Mitigate the harms at multiple layers in your solution to minimize their presence and impact, 
 * and ensure transparent communication about potential risks to users.
 * ==> Operate the solution responsibly by defining and following a deployment and operational readiness plan.

/**
 * Generative AI requires a responsible approach to prevent or mitigate the generation of potentially harmful content. You can use the following practical process to apply responsible AI principles for generative AI:

Identify potential harms relevant for your solution.
Measure the presence of harms when your system is used.
Implement mitigation of harmful content generation at multiple levels of your solution.
Deploy your solution with adequate plans and preparations for responsible operation.
