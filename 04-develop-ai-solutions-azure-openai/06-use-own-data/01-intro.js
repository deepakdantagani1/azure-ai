/**
 * Azure OpenAI enables developers to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by connecting supporting 
 * AI chat models to your own data
 */

/**
 * In this module, you learned how RAG with Azure OpenAI allows developers to use supported AI chat models to reference 
 * specific sources of data. Connecting your own data allows the model to reference the specific information provided and 
 * its pretrained knowledge to provide more effective responses.
