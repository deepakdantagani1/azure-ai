/**
 * Understand How to Build Projects
 * 
 * [Define labels] ---> [Tag data] ---> [Train model] ---> [View model] ---> [Improve model] ---> [Deploy model] ---> [Classify text]
 * 
 * You can work with your project in two ways: through Language Studio and via the REST AP
 * 
 * define labels: Define the labels that you want to classify your text into.
 * tag data: Tag your data with the labels you defined.
 * train model: Train your model on the tagged data.
 * view model: View the performance of your model.
 * improve model: Improve your model by retraining it on more data.
 * deploy model: Deploy your model to a REST endpoint.
 * classify text: Classify text using your model.

/**
 * How to split datasets for training and testing
 * training dataset: The dataset that you use to train your model.
 * testing dataset: The dataset that you use to test your model.
 * 
 * During the Train model step, there are two options for how to train your model.
 * option 1: Train your model using the entire dataset.
 * option 2: Split your dataset into a training dataset and a testing dataset.

/**
 * Deployment options
 * 
 * There are two ways to deploy your model:
 * option 1: Deploy your model to a REST endpoint.
 * option 2: Deploy your model to Language Studio.
